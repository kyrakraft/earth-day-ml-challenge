Carbon Footprint Prediction Model

This project was created for an online machine learning competition focused on predicting individual household carbon footprints using data and engineered features that reflect lifestyle, habits, 
energy behavior, and housing characteristics. The final model uses a stacked ensemble with XGBoost, Ridge Regression, and SVR as base models, and an XGBoost meta-model.
